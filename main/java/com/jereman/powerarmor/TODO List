TODO:
~Finish getting the GUI worked out (Custom Settings; probably need another network class; function in class that adds the custom items)
~Setup stuff for slot amount limit
~Add shift-clicking in Workbench Gui for custom Items/Slots
~Figure out a way to have keybinds for stuff
Ideas:
~Card that can interact with your inventory, syncs with chest (goes on the pants, cuz ender pockets)
~Card that eats for you (lore: "Don't worry, it doesn't bite")
~Invisibility Card (player.setInvisible)
~Armor Invisibility Card
~Finish Night Vision Card
~Creative Flight Card
~Card that saves your inventory on death (or just hotbar)
~Jetpack Card (If I'm feeling adventurous)
~Jesus Card
