TODO:
~compile array list for all upgrades and file path on startup. (Necessary for other mods' mod ID)
~Fix GUI disappearing on first click
~Look into stupid code for cardSpeed and cardJump (start in PowerPants class)
~Setup config for capacity on armor, use config value instead of metadata on tooltips
~Figure out a way to have keybinds for stuff (Going to take a lot of work)
~Setup variables for power, display as durability
~If I feel like it, work on IGuiFactory stuff
~Fix GUI showing variables for null variables
Ideas:
~Card that can interact with your inventory, syncs with chest (goes on the pants, cuz ender pockets)
~Card that eats for you (lore: "Don't worry, it doesn't bite")
~Invisibility Card (player.setInvisible)
~Card that saves your inventory on death (or just hotbar)
~Jetpack Card (If I'm feeling adventurous)
~Water breathing
~Thorns upgrade
~Lightning strike around you
~More tooltips/descriptions
