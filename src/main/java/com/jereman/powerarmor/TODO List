TODO:
~Figure out a way to have keybinds for stuff (Going to take a lot of work)
~Setup variables for power, display as durability
Ideas:
~Card that can interact with your inventory, syncs with chest (goes on the pants, cuz ender pockets)
~Card that eats for you (lore: "Don't worry, it doesn't bite")
~Invisibility Card (player.setInvisible)
~Card that saves your inventory on death (or just hotbar)
~Jetpack Card (If I'm feeling adventurous)
