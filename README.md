# PowerArmor
Jereman's fully customizable armor
Power Armor aims to provide a completely customizable armor experience for players. The mod centers around installing Upgrades in armor pieces, each upgrade adding a distinct ability to the player at the cost of energy. Each piece of armor has a certain amount of upgrades it can hold, however, based on the teir. Higher level armor can have up to 5 upgrade slots, while cheaper/lower level armor may have as little as 1 or 2 slots.
Each upgrade that has changeable values (jump height, speed, damage resistance, etc) is able to have said values modified once installed (using the armor workbench), down to very minute values. Of course these values will determine how much energy is consumed when each upgrade is used.
There are also value caps on upgrades depending on the teir of upgrade; a teir 2 jump upgrade will allow you to jump heigher than a teir 1 would have.
